<!--
  Thanks for filing a pull request on GraphQL Tools!

  Please look at the following checklist to ensure that your PR
  can be accepted quickly:
-->

TODO:

- [ ] If this PR is a new feature, reference an issue where a consensus about the design was reached (not necessary for small changes)
- [ ] Make sure all of the significant new logic is covered by tests
- [ ] Rebase your changes on master so that they can be merged easily
- [ ] Make sure all tests and linter rules pass
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with your change. Include a description of your change, link to PR (always) and issue (if applicable). Add your CHANGELOG entry under vNEXT. Do not create a new version number for your change yourself.
