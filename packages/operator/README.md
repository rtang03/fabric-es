### Overview

Currently, it does three major functions

- install/instantiate/upgrade eventstore chaincode
- install/instantiate/upgrade privata chaincode
- registerAndEnroll user

Note: The collections definition of privatadata is at `collections.json`, is tentative.
Later, when there is clearer requirement, it shall modify.

### Deployment Scenarios

Currently, it provides 4 configurable deployment scenario, inside `script` of package.json.
You can go to `src/scenario` to customize them. All deployment scenario requires a crypto-material
generated by Fabric CA server.

Here is using network3. The network 2 and network 3 are virtually the same, in term of folder
structure of `artifacts`. Network2 is generated via scripts, with channel created, and
chaincodes pre-installed. Network3 copies the artifacts from network2; therefore, network3
has no pre-existing channel and chaincodes.

Also, network3 is 2Org2Peer network.

The first scenario "scenario:eventstore" must be executed first; which it run cleanup, and then
creates channel & enroll admins.

```text
// inside package.json
    "scenario:eventstore": "npm run prepare-asset && ts-node src/scenario/deploy2Orgs2Peers.ts",
    "scenario:privatedata": "ts-node src/scenario/install-instantiate-privatedata.ts",
    "scenario:eventstore-upgrade": "ts-node src/scenario/upgrade-eventstore-cc.ts",
    "scenario:privatedata-upgrade": "ts-node src/scenario/upgrade-privatedata-cc.ts",
    "scenario:post-install-test": "ts-node src/scenario/post-install-test.ts",
```
