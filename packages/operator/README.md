### Notes

Currently, it does two major functions
- install/instantiate/upgrade eventstore chaincode
- install/instantiate/upgrade privata chaincode

The collections definition of privatadata is at `collections.json`, is tentative. 
Later, when there is clearer requirement, it shall modify.  

Besides, it provides the helper functions, e.g. `createUser`, to other packages.
