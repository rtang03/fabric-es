    # [Optional]. If the application is going to make requests that are reserved to organization
    # administrators, including creating/updating channels, installing/instantiating chaincodes, it
    # must have access to the admin identity represented by the private key and signing certificate.
    # Both properties can be the PEM string or local path to the PEM file. Note that this is mainly for
    # convenience in development mode, production systems should not expose sensitive information
    # this way. The SDK should allow applications to set the org admin identity via APIs, and only use
    # this route as an alternative when it exists.

  # These are necessary information to make transaction lifecycles work, including MSP IDs and
  # peers with a public URL to send transaction proposals. The file will not contain private
  # information reserved for members of the organization, such as admin key and certificate,
  # fabric-ca registrar enroll ID and secret, etc.
