### Prerequisite
Require a running Fabric network

### Enrol Admin  
If admin is not previously enrolled, or the network is redeployed, need to run
```shell script
yarn run enrollAdmin
```

Notes:
- If running test `yarn run test:service.ngac.pe.int.1u`, you need to prepare another admin from 
org2, i.e. need to run `yarn run enrollAdminOrg2` beforehand.
